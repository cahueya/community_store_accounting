# Electronic Accounting for concrete5 Community Store

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

An addition to the concrete5 community store (https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store) that allows the submission of successfull paid Orders to a Accounting handler via Email with XML attachment or by CURL request.

## Installation
You must install the community store before installing this addon.

## Current Version
The current version is scoped towards the needs of Italian eAccounting, that is why there are some configuration values (PEC, codice destinatorio) that may be unknown. I plan to localize the package in a way that only those values are shown that are needed in the tax system of where the shop owners reside.
